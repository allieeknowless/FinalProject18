# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

Matching Game! Choose two cards at a time to flip over, and try to make color pairs. If the two cards do not match, they will turn back face down. If they do match, they will stay flipped over. Try to find all eight color pairs on the board. Just be careful, the game ends after 20 guesses. Run finalmatching.py to play!
